# Mathematical Graph implementation with Python
Python project on Mathematical Graph done as a group assignment at Naya College as part of python course<br>
The idea of this project is to implement a Mathematical Graph with it's Nodes, neighbors, edges and weights
using python.
This project also includes some Graph implementations such as agent traveling problem and social relationships problems.

## getting Started
in order to use this code , you need to have python installed on your computer/server<br>
- This project will work only on Python 3.X and above
- project files:<br>
> - "Mathematical Graph - Final Python Project Final.ipynb" - pyhton project<br>
> - social.txt , travelsEW.csv, travelsWE.csv - input files<br>
> - "Python mini-project - graphs.pdf" - project assignment document which according to it ,this project was build<br>

## Authors
- **Itzik Yohanan**<br>
- **Yossi Belitsky**<br>
- **Emanuel Shirbint**<br>

## Deployment
This code include the basic Nodes & Graphs classes toegther with tests done to check it<br>
and other implementions of those classes.<br>
in order to use it for other perpuses - you need to use only the python classes / fuctions written to support these classes.<br>
